## Sam Stone ## 
### BS Electrical Engineering, Binghamton University 2019 ###

I have experience in product design, specifically with injection molded products and aerospace-grade electronics. I have also conducted research in interface science and computer vision. I have filed for a number of patent-pending inventions related specifically to solving problems for various customers. I enjoy the challenge of difficult projects and relish the opportunity to employ my skills. I have done design and research work on projects in the demanding medical and aerospace industries as well as simpler design projects. Through my education, I have experience with mathematical modeling of systems, signal analysis, industrial and autonomous robotics, and computer programming.

Recently, I've been working more and more on Digital Signal Processing and Machine learning. I've published several papers on Radar Signal Processing at Tri-Service Radar Symposium.
