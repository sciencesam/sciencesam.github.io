## Sam Stone<br><sup>Signal Processing and Machine Learning Engineer</sup>

I am an Electrical Engineer interested in applying signal processing and machine learning to solve problems in embedded systems.

As an engineer, I work on systems engineering/architecture, broadband signal processing, phased arrays, and machine learning (mainly deep learning) at Lockheed Martin and, previously, at SRC. As an intern, I worked in product design, specifically with injection molded products, at Tessy Plastics and aerospace-grade electronics at Collins Aerospace. I have filed for a number of patent-pending inventions related specifically to solving problems for various customers. My coursework at Binghamton University, where I got my B.S. in Electrical Engineering, was focused on signal processing, including some Master's classes in DSP. 

Recently, I've been working more and more on Radar Signal Processing and Machine learning. I've published several papers on Radar Signal Processing at the IEEE Radar Conference and Tri-Service Radar Symposium. I presented a paper on Deep Learning and published an article on connected, autonomous cars.

I am very involved in the IEEE. I am currently the Treasurer for the Syracuse IEEE Section and Young Professionals Coordinator "YP Chair" for [IEEE Region 1](https://ieeer1.org/group/young_professionals/) \(Northeast USA\).
