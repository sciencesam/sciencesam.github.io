I wrote an [article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8943255) for IEEE Potentials Magazine based on my pitch for the [SAE WCX Connected Vehicle Challenge]({% post_url 2019-05-11-connected_vehicle %}). In the paper, I go into detail about the application of connected vehicles to hazard detection and tracking, along with a general survey on connected cars.
