I wrote an [article](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8943255) for IEEE Potentials Magazine based on my work for the SAE WCX Connected Vehicle Challenge. In the paper, I go into detail about the application of connected vehicles to hazard detection and tracking, along with a general survey on connected cars.
