[The paper](/_files/2021015_sstone_espector_ML_MPE.pdf) was included in the proceedings of the 2021 IEEE WNYISPW [on IEEE Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9661285). The [conference](https://ewh.ieee.org/r1/rochester/sp/WNYISPW2021.html) was hosted at the Rochester Institute of Technology.
