Three concept papers I co-authored were accepted to the 2020 IEEE Radar Challenge.

<!-- excerpt-end -->
The Radar Challenge is mean to show the magic of radar in a personal, tangible and experiential way—offering an opportunity to create and “see” invisible radar waves interacting with their environment. The goal is to build a community of radar builders that collectively explore the art of the possible in making “COTS-based” radars. We submitted three papers: one based on a [mmWave automotive radar](https://www.ti.com/tool/IWR1843BOOST), one based on incremental improvements to the [MIT Coffee Can Radar](https://hackaday.com/2012/12/18/build-a-360-synthetic-aperture-radar-with-mits-opencourseware/), and using [RTL-SDR combined with TV Downconverters](https://www.rtl-sdr.com/receive-up-to-4-5-ghz-on-your-rtl-sdr-for-5-using-a-directv-downconverter/)

The papers are listed on the conference website [here][challenge-news-link]
