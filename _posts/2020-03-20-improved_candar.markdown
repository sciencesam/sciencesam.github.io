Concept I developed for improvements to the MIT Coffee Can Radar, adding angle-of-arrival
<!-- excerpt-end -->
I submitted the [paper](/_files/Improved Candar.pdf) for the [2020 IEEE Radar Challenge][challenge-news-link].

The idea was to add a second coherent recieve channel to the MIT Coffee Can Radar so it can be used to teach students about angle of arrival estimation. The current CANDAR only has a single recieve channel.
